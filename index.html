                <h1>A Breif Life History:</h1>
                <strong><small>My Life:</small></strong>
                   <p>I was born in La Mirada California. It is a suburb of Los Angeles.<br>
                    I moved to a tiny desert town at a very young age called Helendale.<br>
                    Helendale is in the middle of the Mojave desert in between Victoville<br>
                    and Barstow California. At age 11 I then moved to Phoenix Arizona, huge<br>
                    culture shock by the way. Within the next six years my family life would<br>
                    take a turn for the worse. To keep my mind off all the problems going on<br>
                    around me, I turned all my attention to tinkering. I would spend hours in my<br>
                    room taking apart electronics to see how they worked. I would try making<br>
                    different things out of them, although most of the time it never worked.<br>
                    A few times I even went door to door to see if people had tv's or any other<br>
                    type of electronics they didnt want. You would be amazed how much stuff you<br>
                    could get this way. At 17 I moved to North carolina where I got my first real<br>
                    job in the Corrigated Industry. That is when I knew I was born to work. I<br>
                    loved it, the feeling to be proud of a hard day's work. From there I would move<br>
                    on to try new type's of work.</p>

                <h1>A Brief Work History:</h1>
                <strong><small>Work:</small></strong>
                  <p>My first real job was in the Corrugated Industry making card board boxe's. I<br>
                   absolutly loved it! Every day I would leave to go home after working long days,<br>
                   I was always filled with pride that I did a good days work. I always knew that my<br>
                   work produced quality, good looking product that the customer would be happy with.<br>
                   I would move state to state approximatly every three years due to plant lay-off's,<br>
                   and even closures. In that Industry lay-off's were extremly common. After several<br>
                   years of it, I grew tired of the job uncertainty. I then decided to move onto<br>
                   over the road commercial truck driving. I spent 10 years driving truck and found myself<br>
                   yet again loving every minute of it. The sheer feeling of open freedom. No one telling<br>
                   you what to do, no one telling you how to do it. It was completely up to me whether or<br>
                   not I would be successfull or fail. In July 2017 I would experiance total computer failure<br>
                   going down flagstaff mountain heading into Phoenix. It resulted in a roll-over that ended<br>
                   my truck driving career after driving over 1.5 million miles accident free.<br>
                   By now I reside in Illinois, and soon come across a companie called Rayovac.<br>
                   I knew right away this was where I belonged. Totaly amazing co-wporkers, amazing<br>
                   management. A complete package. I truly wanted to retire here. A few years after working there<br>
                   the companie that owned Rayovac sold it to Energizer Holdings. Everyone knows who they are.<br>
                   It only took Energizer one year to announce that they were closing Rayovac down, and moving<br>
                   all there locations to a new plant in Franklin, Indiana. During my short time at Rayovac<br>
                   I quickly went from the lowest production position to the highest. I was a Lead Packaging<br>
                   Specialist. I was in charge of multiple lines and reported directly to top management.<br>
                   My rapid rise was noticed by Corporate Energizer. They asked me to be part of a very small<br>
                   plant start-up team in Indiana. I assisted in the new start-up for two years. Rayovac in Dixon,<br>
                   Illinois officaly closed forever Dec. 31st 2021. That is what has led me to Coding Temple<br>
                   To learn Computer coding, thanks to a few co-workers.</p>
